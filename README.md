# Facial-Recognition-App

I worked on a facial recognition project that utilized a 
Siamese neural network architecture with three layers of convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs). The primary goal was to develop an efficient and accurate 
facial recognition system that could handle variations in pose, lighting 
conditions, and facial expressions. The project leveraged Python libraries, 
particularly TensorFlow and Keras, for implementation and evaluation.

## FINAL APP:
The integration of the Kivy library in the facial recognition project not only 
improved the visual aesthetics of the application but also bolstered its usability 
and accessibility. The amalgamation of Kivy's interactive capabilities with the 
powerful Siamese neural network-based facial recognition system led to a 
professional-grade application with potential for real-world deployment.
